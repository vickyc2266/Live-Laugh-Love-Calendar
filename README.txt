The name of my TP project is called Live, Laugh, and Love Yourself and it is a 
calendar program that allows its users to plan their schedule on a weekly basis. 
This program does not include any sort of libraries or shortcut commands and 
users can easily run it by using their device's mouse to click on buttons and 
their device's keyboard to type in inputs. All of the graphics users will be 
seeing were imported from CMU 112 graphics and the main file users should use 
to run this program would be the "FinalizedTP" file that imports both from 
CMU 112 graphics and another file titled "FinalizedTPClasses" that contains all
the class information used throughout the "FinalizedTP" file. After running the 
"FinalizedTP" file, users main will be brought to a main home screen where 
different buttons will allow users to access different functionalities of the 
program. The main functionalities of this program is within the calendar screen
which can be accessed when users click on the "Calendar" button. In the calendar
screen, users will see a week view of the calendar which contains all the days 
of a week and by clicking on different buttons and typing in different 
informations, users can update their calendar and plan their weekly schedules. 
An "Add Event" button exists where users can categorize and add events to the 
calendar while the "Delete Event" allows its users to delete any existing events
that's already on the calendar. The "TO DO" button allows users to create a 
to do list of events they want to happen on a certain day but they don't know 
when the event can exactly occur in. In this case, the program will find a legal
and unoccupied time on the calendar for those events to happen if there does 
exists all possible times.
